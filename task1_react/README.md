# Task 1 (React):
Write a simple react-app to search for movies
* The application has to be ReactJS based (no TypeScript)
* Users can search for movies by typing the title in a search field
* The search field should have an auto-complete feature
* If a user selects a movie, details of the movie (like title, poster, rating, â€¦) should be
displayed
* Customize the style of your components
* Use themoviedb.org API (or any other API you like) to retrieve the data
* * Documentation:
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
* * API Key (v3 auth): f3a05026119d09f84c9aaef927a18ac2 (or create your own)
* You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as
possible
