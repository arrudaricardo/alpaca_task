# Task 2 (Django):
Create a Django model structure for Facebook Groups
* Make yourself familiar with the structure of Facebook groups and their content. If
you like, you can join one of our Facebook housing groups for that purpose, e.g., our
Berlin group.
* You only need to create the models.py that resembles the group structure, no other
files are required
* You donâ€™t need to create fields for all attributes you find, a few examples are
enough - the overall model structure and relationships between the models are the
key focus of this exercise
* However, please make sure to create models for the most important elements,
including groups, users (i.e., members of the group), posts, comments and replies
